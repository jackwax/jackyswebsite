In most story-driven video games, the player character is one who has little to no backstory, such that the player can see the character they are playing as an extension of themselves. What if this wasn’t the case? What if the player character had a whole life they lead unbeknownst to the player at the game’s start? Then we can think of playing as this person as almost like a possession. How would players adjust to this character’s life? How would it affect the people that know this character?

Exchange is about a marriage that is falling apart. Players possess John, a man in his early 40s who, eight years ago, inherited 20 million dollars from his now deceased parents. He works in low level real estate. He is married to Jackie, a woman in her mid-late 20s, who is pregnant with John’s child. John is pressuring Jackie to quit her job once the baby comes. Jackie wants to continue her career, afraid that her life is ending into motherhood before it even begins. This is the main conflict of our story.

Exchange takes place in John’s condo, a two-floor modern apartment. There is a view outside the apartment to a skyline but it obscured by surrounding buildings. The clutter of objects in the space differs between our two characters: John’s side of the apartment is cluttered with empty food and beer bottles, and papers stacked everywhere. The spaces that Jackie occupies is neurotically tidy.

John interacts with Jackie throughout the apartment. They tackle these conflicts through dialogue and various chores that need to be done throughout the apartment. The game has no happy ending. The “perfect ending” is Jackie simply leaving John. The “Dark Ending” is something much more violent and sinister.
